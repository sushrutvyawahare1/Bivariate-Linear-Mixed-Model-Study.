# Bivariate-Linear-Mixed-Model-Study.

Linear mixed effects models is increasingly common in the analysis of biological data. It offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures. It includes a combination of fixed and random effects as predictor variables.
These models are powerful. 
Software advances have made these tools accessible to the non-expert and have become relatively straightforward to fit in widely available statistical packages such as R. Here I am going to focus on the implementation of LMMs using R.
To perform multivariate LMMs in R there is not any specific package yet. So, let's see how it's done. 
Basically you need to create dummy variables for each variable on which you want to perform mixed models. You can follow the steps as shown the "Mixed Model.Rmd" file.
